## File Checksum

File checksum is an old technique to verify the integrity of a file.

And this repository is an Windows and Linux app that generates the MD5 and SHA hashes.

The hash of this app is: d046d6b1453e708b144ce791f745d15e087fa78fb0219bc51223ad02b5f2c1e2.

Any other hash means it was modified some way.
